# Prevention Of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?


There are three kinds of behavior that is

- Verbal
- Visual
- Physical

### Verbal

- Sexual or gender-based jokes or remarks.
- Comments about clothing.
- Requests for sexual favors.
- Spreading rumors about a colleague's personal or sexual life.
- Using foul language in the workplace.

### Visual

- Drawing pictures or text of a sexual nature.
- Sexual gesturing.


### Physical

- It includes sexual assault impeding or blocking movement.
- Inappropriate touching such as kissing hugging patting stroking or rubbing sexual gesturing.
- Sexual Assault.
- Leaving unwanted gifts of a sexual or romantic nature.


## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

- Try to be as clear as possible. For example, "It makes me uncomfortable when you rub my shoulders; please do not do this.".
- If this does not work, you should consider putting it in writing and telling the person what conduct you find offensive and what action you will take if it continues.
- For the next time I will complain to the inspection Officer.
- If someone do that kind of thing then we have to take legal action against them so that employee feel comfortable with here work performance and keep motivate them to improve working performance.


## Explains different scenarios enacted by actors.

- Artistic freedom: In this case, sexual harassment that is performed visually is uncomfortable to feel. 
- You have to keep trying since this is similar to how email-based visual sexual harassment behaves. 
- The joke is on you: It's not good that they're sharing information over emails as well. 
- Compliment is not well, some people feel bad depending on the way of accepting.


## How to handle cases of harassment?

For example, we must be careful not to say or do anything that might make someone feel uneasy about their job or their work. We must also always show appreciation for the work of others, refrain from making jokes or comments, and seek to create an environment that is fair to everyone. 


## How to behave appropriately?

As employees, we have to remember to respect one another when we first start working together. I want to stress that this is a quality that must be upheld for a very long time.
