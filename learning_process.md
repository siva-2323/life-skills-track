# Learning Process

## Feynman Technique:

Albert Einstein states that "If you can't explain simply, then you don't understand it well enough". The easiest way to learn anything faster is by explaining it. This technique is named after Richard Feynman, who is a great scientist and he won the noble prize for quantum electrodynamics. He is also a teacher and a great explainer. He states that "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself- and you are the easiest person to fool". if we understand something clearly we can easily explain it to a 5-year-old kid. If we can't means we don't understand that clearly.

## different ways to implement this technique in your learning process:


* take pen, and paper, and note down a topic that you know very well.
* Try to explain the concept in simple terms and practice.
* if you get stuck go back to the source and learn.
* While doing this you may get a lot of doubts and questions try to find the answer to that.


## How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley

Barbara Oakley is a professor of Engineering. She served in the army in her earlier stage in life where she met her future husband. She was interested in Maths, Science, and Technology. She left the army at the age of 26. She researched the brain and its listening capacity. She compared the brain with a Pinball game. our thought is the ball in the game moves through our brain parts like in a pinball game. Our thoughts are not linear. When you are learning, you want to get back and forth, if you get stuck you want to turn your attention from that problem and try again. Dali is a great painter, whenever he is stuck in a problem related to his paintings he moves away from the problem and sits and relaxes in a chair with keys in his hands. As soon as his brain switched from one mode to another he falls asleep as a result the keys fall his hand. The clattering sounds the keys make while hitting the ground wakes him up. And then he starts to focus on his problem. This helps him to solve the problem quicker and much better. Dali and Albert Einstein have some similarities. Einstein also deals with the problem same as Dali. Instead of keys, he use ball bearings. 


## Some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?

* Set a timer for like 25 minutes and turn off all your notifications and focus 100% on a task.
* You don't need to complete the work in 25 minutes but you have to give your 100% focus on that task that is important.
* If you can't find a solution to your problem step aside and take a rest and after some time try again.
* Try the method used by Albert Einstein and Dali.
* Write it down the ideas that come up to your mind and recall them if you get stuck. Reread the points.
* Don't compare your learning power with others.


## How to learn anything - Josh Kaufman:

Josh Kaufman is interested to learn new things. He likes to keep pushing his limits. He researched how long it takes to learn something new. 10,000 hours are needed to be an expert in a certain field. People become good at things when they practice again and again. The story of the learning curve is with a little bit of practice you can be good at things. It takes 20 hours to learn any new things. If you put in 20 hours of focused hard work you will be an expert in no time. Invest the 20 hours in the most effective possible way. You have to get the tools first to learn something. Josh Kaufman learned the ukulele by using the 20 hours learning method. Start it simple and the important things.



## some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?

* Deconstruct the skill.
* Learn enough to self-correct.
* Remove practice barriers.
* Practice at least 20 hours.
